-----------------------------------------
Developing Quality Technical Information

Technical information continues to evolve
============================================
::
    
  Information that you put in an installation guide is not appropriate in an application
  development guide. Different interface display mechanisms require different types of
  information.
  
  When you become more adept at creating meaningful and effective embedded assistance and
  delivering it progressively, you create a better customer experience and become a more
  valuable member of your product team.


::
  
  We are more involved with product design and user interface development, which means that we
  must be involved earlier than ever in the development cycle. The problem with the historic 
  waterfall development process is that downstream teams have very little chance to change 
  anything that happened upstream. Develop ever smaller chunks of information to address the 
  changing needs of users.


::

  An overwhelming majority of customers report that information quality both affects their view 
  of product quality and their overall product satisfaction. Information quality also has a 
  significant impact on customers' buying decisions.
  
  Almost always, users seek answers to specific questions and don't want to read a book from
  beginning to end to find those answers. Quality information addresses users where they are.
  Writers must apply their own skills and expertise based on solid research and proven methods.

Discussion
-----------

- **Will technical writers be replaced by AI?**

::

  My answer is no in the recent decade, but it could happen in 2050 when half of TW disappear.
  
  Technical writers could hardly be replaced by AI completely, no matter how advanced AI brain
  is trained. It is a progressive process AI infinitely approaches to replacing TW.
  
  From the historic perspective, it is slow to witness an occupation disappears, especially the
  occupation that lives a much long time and needs human wisdom as well as creativity.


::

  Besides, AI does have bugs and weakness in wording, rhetoric, contextual analysis, etc. This
  implies that the current AI is not ready for completing high-level writing jobs.
  
  There are still a large proportion of companies and individuals do not believe in AI's ability
  in writing technical documents, though they are much easier than suspense novel for AI.
  Moreover, information security and AI's understanding on our real requirements should be 
  carefully considered.
  
  Concerning creative writing, such as suspense novel, for now, AI is not competent to do this 
  kind of work, or deal with it satisfactorily. Although we can see AI is producing articles to 
  the public and people do not recognize that they are written by computers.
  

::

  But the days get closer. It is worth noting that ChatGPT, the household AI application, becomes
  the significant turning point to TW' career. Closer, no doubt.
  
  Probably in the coming decade, we can see more and more writing jobs will be taken over by AI.
  Meanwhile, we technical writers, or some of us will still be working on our familiar tasks,
  such as writing user guides or API specifications. 

  A well-worn question is raised: do you believe humankind will be manipulated by machines?
  
  

- *What do we consider when reviewing a technical document?*
==========
::

  When reviewing a technical document, need I consider the writing style? If yes, which style?
  How could I ensure that I'm not controlled by my strong bias when reviewing the document?

  1. Exclude personal factors, like emotion, preference, and interests.
  2. What is the audience of this document?
  3. If I were the user, am I clear to do tasks?
  4. Can I search what I want easily?
  

- **How big is the communication gap between developers and writers?**

::

  1. The unsettled problems, as well as ignored issues, cause the big communication gap today.
  2. A new role Linguistic Lark is born to resolve the communication problem between Dev and TW.
  3. How to deploy the Dev-writer?

New application in TW field

- **Wearable user guide**

::
