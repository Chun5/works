0. `DQTI (IBM) <https://chun5.github.io/works/>`_
-------------------------------------------------
::

  DQTI (Developing Quality Technical Information) is the great guide for technical writers.
  
Chapter 1: Technical information continues to evolve
=====================================================
::

  A new generation of technology-savvy users is entering the workforce, existing workers are
  becoming more adept, and technology is becoming more sophisticated. Because of these changes,
  the emphasis is on more usable, intuitive, and appealing products. Now we need to expand our
  focus beyond topic-based information and onto the product user interfaces themselves. Embedded
  assistance (EA) encompasses all textual and graphical elements that users encounter in all
  types of products.

  Progressive disclosure of information
  Information that you put in an installation guide is not appropriate in an application development
  guide. Different interface display mechanisms require different types of information.

Discussion

Will technical writers be replaced by AIÔºü
==========================================
::

  The answer is no in the recent decade, but it could happen in 2050.
  Technical writers can hardly be totally replaced by AI, no matter how advanced AI brain is
  trained. In theory, it is a process AI infinitely approaches to replacing technical writers.
  
  1. It is so slow to witness the disappearance of an occupation.
  2. AI does have bugs or weakness in wording, rhetoric, contextual analysis, etc.
  
  3. Concerning creative writing, such as suspense novel, for now, AI is not competent to do
  this kind of work, or deal with it unsatisfactorily. Although we can see AI is producing
  articles to the public and people can not recognize that they are written by some machine.
  
  For details, please refer to my articles on Github.


What do we consider when reviewing a technical document?
========================================================
::

  1. Exclude personal factors, like emotion, preference, and interests.
  2. What is the audience of this document?
  3. If I were the user, am I clear to do tasks?
  4. Can I search what I want easily?
  

How big is the communication gap between developers and writers?
=================================================================
::

  1. The unsettled problems, as well as ignored issues, cause the big communication gap today.
  2. A new role Linguistic Lark is born to resolve the communication problem between Dev and TW.
  3. How to deploy the Dev-writer?
