1. WorldFirst enterprise solution API specification
----------------------------------------------------
::

  WorldFirst enterprise solution is developed to boost the financial inclusion by driving a
  significant increase in digital payment across the globe. I cooperate with developers and
  SAs, then write API specification documents for the payment related modules.

2. WorldFirst developer center user manual
------------------------------------------
::

  WorldFirst developer center is a platform for developers and partners to build, test, and
  launch WorldFirst products. I write this manual to guide developers through the integration
  process and introduce tools to facilitate their integration with WorldFirst.

3. Zyla documentation center
-----------------------------
::

  Zyla is developed for cross-border businesses trading in multiple currencies. I design the
  information architecture for the documentation center, draw API integration workflow chart,
  and write user manual. I also work with US team members to publish the global documents.

-------------------------------------------------

  DQTI (Developing Quality Technical Information) is the great guide for technical writers.
  
Chapter 1: Technical information continues to evolve
=====================================================
::

  A new generation of technology-savvy users is entering the workforce, existing workers are
  becoming more adept, and technology is becoming more sophisticated. Because of these changes,
  the emphasis is on more usable, intuitive, and appealing products. Now we need to expand our
  focus beyond topic-based information and onto the product user interfaces themselves.
  
  Information that you put in an installation guide is not appropriate in an application
  development guide. Different interface display mechanisms require different types of
  information.
  
  When you become more adept at creating meaningful and effective embedded assistance and
  delivering it progressively, you create a better customer experience and become a more
  valuable member of your product team.


The TW's role today
=====================
::
  
  We are more involved with product design and user interface development, which means that we
  must be involved earlier than ever in the development cycle. The historic waterfall
  development process is made up of specific phases in which each participating team finishes
  its work and hands it to the next team. The problem with this process is that downstream teams
  have very little chance to change anything that happened upstream. Furthermore, because
  documentation is developed close to the end of the cycle, documentation often tries to describe
  a poor design that can no longer be changed. Too often, technical writers who work in a waterfall
  development process must write comprehensive documentation that needs to atone for unwieldy
  design.
  
  More and more development teams are using an agile development process, which depends on
  cross-functional teams working together throughout an iterative development cycle. Although
  members of these cross-functional teams all bring their own skills to the team from their unique
  disciplines, they are much more likely to look at and contribute to each others' deliverables so
  that products are a full team effort. Agile development, as the name implies, lends itself to
  making quick changes to product design when necessary.
  
  When you DQTI, you are responsible for:
  Knowing the user stories (the goals users need to accomplish by using the product) 
  Being the users' advocate, ensuring that the product employs the necessary programmatic assistance
  and embedded assistance
  Owning the words, whether they are in labels in the UI, error messages, or topics that are
  separate from the product

Discussion

Will technical writers be replaced by AIÔºü
==========================================
::

  The answer is no in the recent decade, but it could happen in 2050.
  Technical writers can hardly be totally replaced by AI, no matter how advanced AI brain is
  trained. In theory, it is a process AI infinitely approaches to replacing technical writers.
  
  1. It is so slow to witness the disappearance of an occupation.
  2. AI does have bugs or weakness in wording, rhetoric, contextual analysis, etc.
  
  3. Concerning creative writing, such as suspense novel, for now, AI is not competent to do
  this kind of work, or deal with it unsatisfactorily. Although we can see AI is producing
  articles to the public and people can not recognize that they are written by some machine.
  
  For details, please refer to my articles on Github.


What do we consider when reviewing a technical document?
========================================================
::

  1. Exclude personal factors, like emotion, preference, and interests.
  2. What is the audience of this document?
  3. If I were the user, am I clear to do tasks?
  4. Can I search what I want easily?
  

How big is the communication gap between developers and writers?
=================================================================
::

  1. The unsettled problems, as well as ignored issues, cause the big communication gap today.
  2. A new role Linguistic Lark is born to resolve the communication problem between Dev and TW.
