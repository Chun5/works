0. DQTI (IBM)
-------------------------------------------------
::

  DQTI (Developing Quality Technical Information) is the great guide for technical writers.
  
Chapter 1: Technical information continues to evolve
=====================================================
::

  A new generation of technology-savvy users is entering the workforce, existing workers are
  becoming more adept, and technology is becoming more sophisticated. Because of these changes,
  the emphasis is on more usable, intuitive, and appealing products. Now we need to expand our
  focus beyond topic-based information and onto the product user interfaces themselves.
  
  Information that you put in an installation guide is not appropriate in an application
  development guide. Different interface display mechanisms require different types of
  information.
  
  When you become more adept at creating meaningful and effective embedded assistance and
  delivering it progressively, you create a better customer experience and become a more
  valuable member of your product team.


The TW's role today
=====================
::
  
  We are more involved with product design and user interface development, which means that we
  must be involved earlier than ever in the development cycle. The historic waterfall
  development process is made up of specific phases in which each participating team finishes
  its work and hands it to the next team. The problem with this process is that downstream teams
  have very little chance to change anything that happened upstream. Furthermore, because
  documentation is developed close to the end of the cycle, documentation often tries to 
  describe a poor design that can no longer be changed. Too often, technical writers who work in
  a waterfall development process must write comprehensive documentation that needs to atone for 
  unwieldy design.


Redefining quality technical information
========================================
::

  An overwhelming majority of customers report that information quality both affects their view 
  of product quality and their overall product satisfaction. Information quality also has a 
  significant impact on customers' buying decisions.
  
  Almost always, users seek answers to specific questions and don't want to read a book from
  beginning to end to find those answers. Quality information addresses users where they are.
  Writers must apply their own skills and expertise based on solid research and proven methods.
  
  Develop ever smaller chunks of information to address the changing needs of users.


QTI's characteristics:
======================
- **Easy to use**

  + Task orientation: In the context of a product, a focus on helping users do tasks that
    support their goals

  - Accuracy: Freedom from mistake or error; adherence to fact or truth

  * Completeness: The inclusion of all necessary parts-and only those parts

- **Easy to understand**

  + Clarity: Freedom from ambiguity or obscurity; using language in such a way that users
    understand it the first time that they read it
    
  - Concreteness: The inclusion of appropriate examples, scenarios, similes, analogies,
    specific language, and graphics  

  * Style: Correctness and appropriateness of writing conventions and of words and phrases
  
- **Easy to find**

  + Organization: A coherent arrangement of parts that makes sense to the user
  
  - Retrievability: The presentation of information in a way that enables users to find
    specific items quickly and easily

  * Visual effectiveness: Attractiveness and enhanced meaning of information through the 
    use of layout, illustrations, color, typography, icons, and other graphical devices

Will technical writers be replaced by AIÔºü
==========================================
::

  My answer is no in the recent decade, but it could happen in 2050.
  Technical writers could hardly be replaced by AI completely, no matter how advanced AI brain
  is trained. In theory, it is a process AI infinitely approaches to replacing technical writers.
  
  From the historic perspective, it is so slow to witness an occupation disappears, especially
  the occupation that lives a long time and needs human wisdom and creativity.
  
  Besides, AI does have bugs and weakness in wording, rhetoric, contextual analysis, etc. This
  implies that the current AI is not ready for completing high-level writing jobs.
  
  It is worth noting that ChatGPT, the household AI application, becomes the significant turning
  point to technical writers' career. The days get closer, no doubt.
  
  Probably in the coming decade, we will see more and more writing jobs are taken over by AI.
  Meanwhile, we technical writers, or some of us will still be working on our familiar tasks,
  such as writing user guides or API specifications. 
  
  Because not all companies believe in AI's ability in writing technical documents, though they
  are much easier than suspense novel for AI. Moreover, information security and AI's 
  understanding on our real requirement should be carefully considered.
  
  
  
  Do you believe humankind will be commanded by machines?
  
  3. Concerning creative writing, such as suspense novel, for now, AI is not competent to do
  this kind of work, or deal with it satisfactorily. Although we can see AI is producing
  articles to the public and people can not recognize that they are written by the computers.
  
  For details, please refer to my articles on Github.


What do we consider when reviewing a technical document?
========================================================
::

  When reviewing a technical document, need I consider the writing style?
  How could I ensure that I'm not manipulated by my strong bias when reviewing the document?

  1. Exclude personal factors, like emotion, preference, and interests.
  2. What is the audience of this document?
  3. If I were the user, am I clear to do tasks?
  4. Can I search what I want easily?
  

How big is the communication gap between developers and writers?
=================================================================
::

  1. The unsettled problems, as well as ignored issues, cause the big communication gap today.
  2. A new role Linguistic Lark is born to resolve the communication problem between Dev and TW.
  3. How to deploy the Dev-writer?

üåå About
=========

This blog is written by Austen to share learning outcome and ideas on technical writing.
You can share this page https://z.rtfd.io with others.

  If it is clear to me, it should be clear to them by technical writing.
